Total Energy Consumption

The total energy consumption within the organization for the fiscal years FY2020, FY2019, and FY2018 was recorded as follows:

FY2020: 1,314 GJ

FY2019: 1,310 GJ

FY2018: 1,441 GJ

These figures reflect the aggregate energy usage; however, further disaggregation into specific energy sources and uses is not available at this time.

To enhance transparency and support sustainability initiatives, the organization aims to improve data collection processes and provide a more detailed breakdown of energy consumption in future reporting cycles. Additionally, the organization is in the process of implementing a software system to collect energy consumption data. This initiative is expected to enhance data accuracy and reporting, enabling informed decision-making and improved energy management."
GRI 302-2,302-2 Energy consumption outside of the organization,"a. Energy consumption outside of the organization, in joules or multiples.
b. Standards, methodologies, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used
c. Source of the conversion factors used.","For the fiscal year 2020, ABC Systems Holdings Ltd.'s energy consumption outside the organization totaled 1,314 gigajoules (GJ). This includes energy used for business travel, employee commuting, and outsourced data center operations, which contribute significantly to the organization’s external energy footprint. Energy consumption data was collected from utility bills, fuel receipts, and service provider reports, ensuring alignment with GRI 302: Energy 2016 for consistency and comparability. Standard conversion factors from the International Energy Agency (IEA) were applied to harmonize energy units across various sources and regions.

Compared to fiscal year 2019, when external energy consumption totaled 1,280 GJ, there was a 2.7% increase, primarily driven by higher reliance on outsourced IT infrastructure to support remote operations. Where direct consumption data was unavailable, estimates were made using historical consumption patterns and industry benchmarks, with clear documentation of assumptions used. Moving forward, the company aims to enhance data accuracy by working more closely with energy providers and implementing automated tracking systems."

This ratio includes electricity, heating, and cooling across operations in Hong Kong, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom. The slight improvement from 0.0011 GJ per USD in FY2019 was primarily driven by energy efficiency measures in office spaces and a shift toward remote work, reducing in-office energy use. Where regional revenue data was unavailable, estimates were made based on historical financial trends to ensure a consistent calculation. To further refine accuracy, ABC plans to track energy use by office location and implement a centralized energy management system for more precise monitoring and reduction of consumption."

This reduction, measured against the baseline year of FY2018, includes electricity, heating, and cooling across all operational locations. The decline was driven by efficiency initiatives, such as replacing fluorescent lights with LED systems in the Philippines office, implementing automated power management for office equipment, and optimizing the use of natural light to reduce electricity consumption. Energy reductions were calculated using GHG Protocol guidelines and ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS) standards in the Hong Kong office.

This reduction, measured against a FY2018 baseline, was primarily driven by server optimization in cloud-based services, enhancements in software efficiency, and reductions in power consumption of IT infrastructure. The energy savings were assessed by comparing pre- and post-implementation consumption levels using GHG Protocol guidelines for consistency and accuracy. To ensure reliability, the calculations assumed uniform implementation of energy-saving measures across all regions, with adjustments made for differences in product deployment and service usage patterns.

In FY2019, total water consumption was 218 cubic meters, representing a 34% reduction from 331 cubic meters in FY2018. This data is metered, collected through water flow meters and utility bills, and verified via internal audits to ensure accuracy. All water used is discharged into municipal wastewater systems and treated in compliance with local environmental regulations. To mitigate water-related impacts, ABC has set a target to reduce water consumption by 10% by FY2022, focusing on installing water-efficient fixtures, enhancing leakage detection systems, and promoting conservation practices among employees.
